# Circular Motion

Welcome to this ineractive sine wave generator.
On the top right corner there are some sliders to control the wave frequency, amplitude, wavelength, y-axis, color range of the wave, background colors, etc. Feel free to manipulate the values as you like and play around with it to create beautiful patterns.
